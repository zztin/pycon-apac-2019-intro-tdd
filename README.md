## Business Logic

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_card_number#Issuer_identification_number_.28IIN.29

| Issuer           | IIN ranges |
| ---------------- | ---------- |
| American Express | 34, 37     |
| MasterCard       | 51â€“55      |
| Visa             | 4          |

The card number has to start with the mentioned IIN range(s).

## Running Tests

```
$ pytest
```

## Tasks

1. Write a `TestCase` class, maybe `ValidCreditCardTest`.
2. Turn the functions into methods of the class.
3. Write another `TestCase` class (maybe `CardIssuerConfusionTest`) to cover negative cases.
(Invalid card numbers, like VISA marked as MasterCard)
